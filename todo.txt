Done:
    2022-04-04:
        - [??] basic data models for each element of the FBD hierarchy
        - [1] added hash and comparison via base object (FBDObj)
    2022-04-05:
        - [2.1] add_function now works
    2022-04-06:
        - [2.2] relatively naive interconnect created
        - [2.3] connectivity matrix is hashable out of the box
    2022-04-10:
        - [3.1] redone a lot of the compile process
    2022-04-12_
        - [3.2] done some function compiling

Planned:
    [3] make the first compiler (fbd --> python 3)
        [3.1] compile one diagram as one class with collected state
        [3.2] compile unique functions of diagram as class functions
        [3.3] make the state of each FB instance a class variable
        [3.4] compile a "step" function for the entire diagram
            - this is where we run into cycle detection and order of execution problems
        [3.5] come up with a better way to compile code (maybe output sections?)
