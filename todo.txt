Done:
    2022-04-04:
        - [??] basic data models for each element of the FBD hierarchy
        - [1] added hash and comparison via base object (FBDObj)
    2022-04-05:
        - [2.1] add_function now works
    2022-04-06:
        - [2.2] relatively naive interconnect created
        - [2.3] connectivity matrix is hashable out of the box
    2022-04-10:
        - [3.1] redone a lot of the compile process
    2022-04-12:
        - [3.2] done some function compiling
    2022-04-15:
        - realized that content stored as fbd diagram is too verbose:
            there is no need to store interface data for each function block!
            storing interface of each unique function once is enough, the rest
            is encoded in the connection matrix
    2022-04-16:
        - [4] rearranged diagram data to store only unique function interfaces
    2022-04-18:
        - [3.2] technically speaking we have this done now (unique func sections are OK)
        - [3.1][3.3] added mechanism to declare and initialize state

Planned:
    [3] make the first compiler (fbd --> python 3)
        [3.4] compile a "step" function for the entire diagram
            - this is where we run into cycle detection and order of execution problems
